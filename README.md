### liri-node-app
LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

## Overview
LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.
To run the app the user need to type in the terminal/command line <node liri.js> and one of the following commands:
- `spotify-this-song` <name of the song the user wants to get information about>
= `concert-this` <name of the artist/band to get information about the coming concerts>
- `movie-this` <name of the movie the user wants to get information about>
- `do-what-it-says` (in this case, LIRI will take the text inside of random.txt and then use it to call one of LIRI's commands.
